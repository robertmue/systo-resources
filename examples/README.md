# systo-resources/examples

## About

This contains HTML documents illustrating how Systo widgets can be assembled to make a web page.

## Local usage

Simply upload the zip file for systo-resources to your own computer, and unzip the file into some suitable location.   You can then open up (almost) any HTML file in the examples directory in your favourite browser (Chrome is recommened, bcause all Systo development took place using Chrome), and try them out.  Look at the source code to see how each example is structured, how it accesses the files containing Systo languages, models and widgets, and how the widgets are refeerned in the HTML.   

The (currently) only exception to being able to open up an example HTML page in your browser is "example_ian.html".    This requires that you start up a local server on your own computer, and open up the HTML page using an address like http://192.168.0.2:8000/XXXX/example_ian.html, where XXXX is a directory path to the Systo examples.   If you have experience of using a local server, or have access to someone who does, this should be enough information; otherwise, you will need to skip this example until I can provide more comprehensive instructions.
