{"id":"cascade","language":"system_dynamics","name":"4-tank cascade","title":"","description":"This model represents a set of 4 tanks, connected in a linear sequence.  At the start, tank1 contains some water while the other 3 are empty.   Water drains out of the first one into the second, and so on, ending up in tank4.  Each flow is simply proportional to the amount of water in its source tank, with the constants k1, k2 and k3 determining the proportional loss per unit of time.","author":""}
