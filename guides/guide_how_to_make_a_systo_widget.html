        <h1>Systo Guide: How to make a Systo widget</h1>

        <p>This Guide takes you through the process of making a Systo-compliant widget.
        By "Systo-compliant" I mean that it is able to be used in conjunction with a Systo
        model, whether it be to display some information about the model structure (as in
        this Guide), to display simulation results, or for some other purpose.</p>

        <p>We begin with some conventional HTML+Javascript code that is able to report on 
        some aspect of a Systo model
        (listing the nodes it contains) <u>without</u> making use of a widget.   This
        shows how to access information about the model, and should be a good stepping-off
        point for the next step, when we separate out the information-displaying code into
        a separate file, as a working Systo widget.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: No widget</h2>
        <p>In this step, we will write a simple HTML page to report on some aspect of a
           Systo model.  This will involve making a list of the nodes in the model, along
           their node type.</p>

        <h3>Code</h3>
        <pre class="html">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Systo Widget-writing Guides: 1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../js/all_core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../languages/system_dynamics.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../models/cascade.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            $(document).ready(function() {
                var modelId = "cascade";
                var model = SYSTO.models[modelId];
                var nodes = model.nodes;
                var nodes_html = "&lt;ul&gt;";
                for (var nodeId in nodes) {
                    var node = nodes[nodeId];
                    nodes_html += "&lt;li&gt;"+node.label+": "+node.type+"&lt;/li&gt;";
                }
                nodes_html += "&lt;/ul&gt;";
                $("#nodes").html(nodes_html);
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are the nodes in the cascade model:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div id="nodes"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>Save this as HTML, and open it up in a browser.  You should see:</p>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Here are the nodes in the cascade model:</p>
            <div id="nodes">
                <ul><li>tank1: stock</li>
                <li>tank2: stock</li>
                <li>tank3: stock</li>
                <li>tank4: stock</li>
                <li>flow1: valve</li>
                <li>flow2: valve</li>
                <li>flow3: valve</li>
                <li>k1: variable</li>
                <li>k2: variable</li>
                <li>k3: variable</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>There are 4 &lt;script&gt; elements.  The first should be used in all Systo-based web pages,
        and provides jQuery, jQuery-UI, and core Systo utilities.  The second loads the definition of a
        particular Systo language - in this case, system_dynamics.   The third loads the definition of
        a particular Systo model - in this case, the "cascade" model of water flow between 4 tanks.</p>

        <p>Finally, there is the custom script for this page.  This shows how to extract information 
        about a model from SYSTO.models, an object literal "hash" or "map" which cancontain definitions
        for many models: we select the one we want using the model's ID (SYSTO.models[modelId] ).  We 
        loop over the objects (nodes) within the model, get each node;s label and type, and build up
        an HTML string in the variable nodes_html.</p>

        <p>The final line of our script <br.<
             <pre>$("#nodes").html(nodes_html);</pre>
        uses our first bit of jQuery.   $("#nodes") selects an element from the HTML from furtehr down
        in the file according to the id attribute of the element.   So in this case it selects the
        div with an id="nodes".   The .html(nodes_html) uses the jQuery html() method to insert the
        HTML string contained in the variable nodes_html into the specified element.<p>

        <h2>Step 2: Our first widget</h2>
        <p>We have now written an HTML page that does a useful job - it reports on the nodes in a Systo
        model.   However, the code for doing this is hard-wired into this particular page.   Wouldn't it
        be great if we could put the JavaScript vode into a separat file, so that anyone wanting to do the
        same job could easily incorporate it into their own page, without having to copy all the code?</p>

        <p>[Of course, in this case we need only a few lines to do the job.  But remember that we are
        learning how to make widgets, so it makes sense to start off with something small that highlights
        the widget-making aspects and doesn't confuse us with lots of task-specific code.]</p>

        <p>Here is what our HTML file will look like when we have taken out the lines that are specific to
        the particular task of reporting on the nodes in a model:

        <h3>HTML page</h3>
        <pre class="html">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Systo Widget-writing Guides: 1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../js/all_core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../languages/system_dynamics.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../models/cascade.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        <b>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="nodeListing_step02.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>
        &lt;script&gt;
            $(document).ready(function() {
                <b>$("#nodes").nodeListing({modelId:"cascade"});</b>
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are the nodes in the cacade model:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div id="nodes"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>We have made just two changes (highlighted in bold).</p>

        <p>First, we have added in another &lt;script&gt; element:</p>
        <pre>&lt;script&gt; type="text/javascript" src="nodeListing_step02.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
        <p>which loads our (yet to be written) widget code.</p>
        <p>Second, we have cut out all the lines that found information
        on each node, and replaced it with a single line:</p>
                <pre>$("#nodes").nodeListing({modelId:"cascade"});</pre>
        <p>The first part of this, <pre>$("#nodes")</pre> is the same as before.   The second part, 
        <pre>.nodeListing({modelId:"cascade"});</pre> now "attaches" the widget "nodeListing" (which we
        are about to make, with this element, rather than inserting HTML into it, as we did before.  So,
        let"s see what this widget might look like.</p>

        <p>And here it is.</p>

        <h3>Widget</h3>
        <pre class="widget">
(function ($) {
    $.widget("systo.nodeListing", {

        options: {
            modelId:null
        },

        _create: function () {
            var self = this;
            this.element.addClass("nodeListing-1");
            var div = $("&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");

            <b>var modelId = self.options.modelId;
            var model = SYSTO.models[modelId];
            var nodes = model.nodes;
            var nodes_html = "&lt;ul&gt;";
            for (var nodeId in nodes) {
                var node = nodes[nodeId];
                nodes_html += "&lt;li&gt;"+node.label+": "+node.type+"&lt;/li&gt;";
            }
            nodes_html += "&lt;/ul&gt;";
            $(div).html(nodes_html);</b>

            $(this.element).append(div);
        }
    });
})(jQuery);
        </pre>
        <p>In this code block, I have used bold to show the code that has not changed from the first step.
        The only exception is that the generated HTML is now assigned to a &lt;div&gt; element within the
        widget (stored in the variabled "div"), rather than to a &lt;div&gt; in the main HTML page.</p>

        So, this is your first Systo widget.   In fact (in all probability) this is your first jQuery UI
        widget.   We will explore what this means in the next section, but let us just reflect for a moment
        on what you have now achieved.  You have made a utility that anyone in the world could incorporate into
        their own Systo-enable web page with a mere 3 lines of code:
        <ul>
            <li>A &lt;script&gt; element in the header section of the page;</li>
            <li>An empty &lt;div&gt; element in the body of the page;</li>
            <li>A JavaScript statement to assign the widget to the &lt;div&gt; element.
        </ul>
        That is quite an achievement!</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Re-using the widget in the same page</h2>
        <p>As well as making life simpler for other people, you can use the widget to make life simpler for 
        you as well.  Perhapd you would like to generate a list of the nodes in a model for more than one
        model in the same web page?   Simple, as the following example shows:</p>
        <pre class="html">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Systo Widget-writing Guides: 1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../js/all_core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../languages/system_dynamics.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../models/cascade.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        <b>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../models/minworld.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="nodeListing_step02.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            $(document).ready(function() {
                $("#nodes").nodeListing({modelId:"cascade"});
                <b>$("#nodes1").nodeListing({modelId:"miniworld"});</b>
            });
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are the nodes in the cascade model:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div id="nodes"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        <b>&lt;p&gt;And here are the nodes in the miniworld model:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div id="nodes1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</b>
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>We say that there are two (or more) <u>instances</u> of the same widget, each
        bound to a different HTML element.</p>


        <h2>providing additional options</h2>
        <p>Very commonly, we would like to provide the web-page builder with the ability to
        control various aspects of the widget.   For example, to provide more control over the
        styling of the widget; the format it uses for producing its report (table or 
        bullet-points; the properties of each node that are displayed; or to restrict the types
        of nodes that are included.   All these requirements, and more, are handled by widget <u>options</u>.</p>

        <p>The beauty about the jQuery UI Widget Factory - and one of the main reasons for adopting it -
        is that it provides a consistent way of handling options, so once you (the widget developer
        or the web page developer) have learnt to work with them for one widget, you will know how to
        work with them for any widget.</p>

        <p>Options can be set in a number of different ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Through default values asssigned when the widget is first created, using default values
            built into the widget, in the widget's "options" property.</li>
            <li>When the widget is first called.  That's what we did with the "modelId" option.  This is
            done by passing an object in (in our case, {modelId:"cascade"} ) when we first called
            the "nodeListing" widget.  This over-rides the widget's default values.</li>
            <li>Once the widget has been created, through a call to the widget's "option" method.</li>
            <li>Once the widget has been created, through a call to some user-defined method for the widget;</li>
            <li>Once the widget has been created, through an event mechanism ("publish/subscribe").
        </ul>
