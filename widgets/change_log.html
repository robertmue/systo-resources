1. Major overhaul of saving to/loading from file
2. Now use model label (actually model.meta.name) for display purposes, but ID also usually visible (e.g. in model menu; Run Control header)
3. All New models are labelled 'noname' -not trying anything clever with giving each one a number.  But ID can be used to discriminate (in the unlikely event that user makes several new models and does not re-label them when saving).
4. Added a 'Clear Local Storage' button in footer - for emergency use.
5. Add last-update date/time to footer (has to be edited manually), plus link to this change log.
6. Loading an incomplete/incorrect model (from file or Local Storage) should now be more robust - simulate() has a try-catch on it to pick up any failure when executing generated code.
7. Only file tabe in open/save dialogues work: user gets a message thatthe others are not yet operational.
8. Label-edit div is now closwed by clicking on a toolbar snode or arc button.

TODO:
1. Still some minor funnies when doing New after loading and running a amodel (e.g. graph and sliders still)
2. End-time issue still needs sorting.
